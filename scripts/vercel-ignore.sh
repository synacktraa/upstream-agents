#   bash ../../scripts/vercel-ignore.sh <app>
# where <app> is "web".

# Exit 0  -> skip the build (no relevant changes)
# Exit 1  -> proceed with the build

#   * its own package directory
#   * any shared workspace package it depends on (agents, common)
#   * top-level files that affect every build (package.json, lockfile, tsconfig, scripts/)
